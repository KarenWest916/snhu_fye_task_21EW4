```

<br>

__Theory:__ The FYE-101 course is a free introductory orientation course designed to help new students familiarize themselves with the learning management system.

__Hypothesis:__ Outreaching students to encourage them to log into FYE-101 will improve FYE-101 login rates.

## Test Design `r fontawesome::fa("flask")` {.tabset .tabset-pills} 

__Test Metric:__ FYE-101 Login Rate, calculated as:
$$FYE101 Login Rate  = \sum_{n=FYE101 Logins} / \sum_{n=Total Registered Students}$$

__Testing Groups:__ Of all eligible members of the population (full criteria list below), control and experiment groups were assigned according to testing cells on the Unify contact.

+ Control Group: **50%** received FYE-101 email and task was created on the Unify record
+ Experiment Group: **50%** received no emails or tasks

Tasks were created on Tuesday each week during the experiment timeframe and emails were sent at the same time. These treatments only occurred the first week that the student was eligible to receive; they did not occur on a weekly basis.

**Experiment Population Eligibility (AKA InPopulation):**

+ UG students with a planned term start of 21EW4
+ Student is registered for FYE-101 but has not logged in

<br>

### Example Email


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("imgs/fye_101_email.png"))
```


### Example Task


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("imgs/fye_task_reminder.png"))
```

## Outcomes & Learnings `r fontawesome::fa("chart-bar")`

__Overall Results:__ As of 3/17/21, the FYE-101 Login Rate for the test group was **4.1 percentage points higher (4.8% change)**. This difference is statistically significant with a 95% confidence level and two-sided test.

<br>
__Learnings:__

__Melt Rate__ The start rate for the test group was **1.9 percentage points higher (2.2% change)**. This difference is statistically significant with a 95% confidence level and two-sided test.

<br>

__Next Steps:__

Systematic Expansion.

__Interpreting the Results__

+ __Confidence Level:__ The percentage of confidence that the result is a consequence of the change made or treatment administered and not a result of random chance.

+ __Statistical Significance:__ A test result is said to be "statistically significant" when the difference between the results of the test and control groups is too big to have been a result of chance.

+ __One-Sided vs. Two-Sided Test__ A one sided test is used when we only want to prove that the *increase* in conversions (i.e. the metric) that occurred for the test group is significant; it does not consider whether any *decrease* in conversions is significant. A two-sided test evaluates the significance of the test group conversions being higher *or* lower as compared to the control. If we want to be certain that a treatment being tested does not have a negative impact on the metric, then a two-sided test should be conducted.
